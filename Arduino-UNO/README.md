# ARDUINO UNO and DHT11 Sensor

This project was developed for the **"Electronics for Applied Physics"** course at the **University of Bologna**.  

You are free to use, modify, and distribute this code for academic and educational purposes.



This project establishes a wireless temperature and humidity monitoring system using an two Arduino UNO with a DHT11 sensor and an RF 433MHz transmitter to send data. On the receiving side,  a RF 433MHz receiver collects the data, displays it on an LCD screen (LM016L)

ðŸ”¹ Features:

âœ” Wireless Data Transmission (RF 433MHz)

âœ” Real-Time Monitoring on LCD & Web Interface

âœ” Low-Power, Cost-Effective Solution
